# Gravity-simulator
The Gravity Simulator project is an OpenGL-based application that simulates the gravitational interaction between stars and planets. The simulation allows the user to create and manipulate two types of objects: stars and planets. Stars act as gravitational centers, while planets are attracted to these stars.
